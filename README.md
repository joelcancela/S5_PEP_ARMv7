# ARM-M0 ROM & RAM generator for Logisim
This is a configuration file generator for Logisim.<br>

It allows to generate configuration files for RAM and ROM components.

It was made to support some ARM-M0 instructions [more details here](doc/instructions.md).

## How to use

You can use any textual file to create configuration files.

### ROM file

* The file must have only one instruction per line
* The immediate must be prefixed with `#`
* The operands are separated with `,` and registers are prefixed with `R`

An example can be seen [here](examples/prog.s).

### RAM file

* The RAM variables must be written in decimal base, separated with a space.

An example can be seen [here](examples/vars.ini).


### Switches

* Use the `-rom` switch to specify the program file to interpret, the output file will be called `rom.ini`.

* Use the `-ram` switch to specify the variables file to interpret, the output file will be called `ram.ini`.

### How to launch

`mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main" -Dexec.args="[args]"`
